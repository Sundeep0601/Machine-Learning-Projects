Introduction
There is a Dream Housing Finance company, which deals in all home loans. They have presence across all urban, semi urban and rural areas. Customer first apply for home loan after that company validates the customer eligibility for loan. Company wants to automate the loan eligibility process (real time) based on customer detail provided while filling online application form. These details are Gender, Marital Status, Education, Number of Dependents, Income, Loan Amount, Credit History and others. To automate this process, I identify the customers segments, those are eligible for loan amount so that customers can be specifically targeted . This is a standard supervised classification task. A classification problem, to predict whether a loan would be approved or not.
