# S&P 500 Market Prediction Model

This project includes the development of a market prediction model for the S&P 500 index, combining the strengths of machine learning and time series analysis to forecast market trends and closing prices.

## Overview

In this project, I will evaluate various machine learning methods to determine the best approach for predicting the S&P 500 performance based on historical data and fundamental analysis. The scope of this project will not include sentiment analysis, which typically involves evaluating market trends, published articles, political news, and investor sentiment such as fear or greed. Instead, the focus will be on leveraging fundamental and technical analysis to forecast the S&P 500's performance.

## Technologies & Algorithms

- **Python**: Primary programming language used for the project.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **yellowbrick**: Visualizing machine learning models and their performance
- **yfinance**: Fetching historical market data.
- **statsmodels**: Implementation of the ARIMA model for time series analysis.
- **Random Forest Classifier**: Trend prediction based on historical data.

## Data Source

I used web.DataReader method to fetch data directly from Yahoo Finance API into dataframe.
